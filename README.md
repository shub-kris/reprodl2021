## Objectives for the exercise

- [x] Pulling images and running containers.
- [x] Building custom images from Dockerfiles.
- [x] Pushing/pulling images from the Docker Hub.


## Prerequisites

1. Complete [Exercise 3](https://github.com/sscardapane/reprodl2021/tree/exercise3_dvc). Leave the MinIO server in execution.
2. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). For using a CUDA-enabled GPU, install the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker).
3. If you are using Visual Studio Code, install the [Docker extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/overview).

Before starting, check that Docker is installed correctly:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

## Preliminaries

[Requirement specifiers](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#requirement-specifiers) are very useful text files detailing all the Python libraries needed for a project. Let us create one!

1. Install `pipreqs`:

```bash
pip install pipreqs
```

2. Generate a requirements.txt file from the current directory:

```bash
pipreqs .
```
3. While powerful, `pipreqs` is not perfect, which is why you should look carefully at the generated file. In particular, at the moment [it sets the wrong dependencies for Hydra](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs/issues/244). __Remove `hydra` from requirements.txt__ (the correct package is `hydra-core`).

### Install a Docker dashboard

It is a good idea to have a decent dashboard to more easily manipulate images and containers. On some systems, you can use the [Docker Dashboard](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/dashboard/). Alternatively, you can use the VS Code plugin.

For a more powerful alternative, you can start a [Portainer CE](https://documentation.portainer.io/quickstart/) container, which is a good exercise in understanding Docker:

```bash
docker volume create portainer_data
docker run -d -p 9001:9000 --name=portainer -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce
```

> :speech_balloon: We are using port 9001 to avoid conflicts with MinIO on port 9000.

From [localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) you can now monitor your Docker installation (see the [initial setup](https://documentation.portainer.io/v2.0/deploy/initial/)).

## Dockerfile \#1: developing in a container

Our first Dockerfile will be a working environment inside which to develop (and launch) the application. See the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r7SbbajL-UnYHOeY9fQ9YtoJdu9Q70U5M_11E68K1Rg/edit?usp=sharing) for a tutorial on building Dockerfiles.

The first Dockerfile `Dockerfile` should:

1. Inherit from the official images of [PyTorch](https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorch/pytorch) or [PyTorch Lightning](https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorchlightning/pytorch_lightning).
2. Install all the required libraries from the requirements file.
3. Install [libsdnfile](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libsndfile1).

Once the Dockerfile is completed, build the image:

```bash
docker build . --rm -t reprodl/env
```

Run the environment in interactive mode:

```bash
docker run -d -it -p 9002:9000 reprodl/env
```
> :speech_balloon: Adding a volume is also a good idea at this point. You can avoid mapping the port if you do not plan to use MinIO.

Find the container ID running `docker ps`, and try attaching to the container running `docker attach <id>`. Alternatively, you can [attach to a running container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/attach-container) from Visual Studio Code.

From inside the container, try to replicate a training run.

## Dockerfile \#2: an executable container

Read about [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/). Add a second stage to the Dockerfile that automatically copies all the required data and launches a training run.

1. You can use the [COPY command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) to copy .py and .yaml files.
2. Pass the MinIO keys using the [ARG command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg).
3. Launch `dvc pull` during the build.
4. Launch the final training command at the end of the Dockerfile with the [CMD command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd).

Build the new Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build . --rm --build-arg AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="minioadmin" --build-arg AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="minioadmin" -t reprodl/train
```

Launch another container:

```bash
docker run reprodl/train
```


## Push / pull from the Docker Hub

You can also try [pushing and pulling](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/) your image using Docker Hub. First, tag your image accordingly:

```bash
docker tag reprodl/env <docker-username>/<project>
```

Then, push the image to the Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push <docker-username>/<project>
```
