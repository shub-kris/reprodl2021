# Reproducible Deep Learning

The repository contains the code for the different tools that I learned from the course [[Official website](https://www.sscardapane.it/teaching/reproducibledl/)]. 

I would like to thank [Prof. Simone Scardapane](https://www.sscardapane.it/) for providing the password for accessing the video lectures. 

This practical course helped me in exploring the design of a simple *reproducible* environment for a deep learning project. I learned following tools and frameworks while doing the exercises:
- [x]  [DVC](http://dvc.org/) for data versioning
- [x] [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for setting up environments 
- [x] [Hydra] (https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) for logging hyperparameters
- [x] [Wandb] (https://wandb.ai/site) Weights and Biases for ML Experimentation Management and Hyperparameter Sweeping
- [x] [Github Actions] (https://github.com/features/actions) Github Actions for Continous Integration
