[[Official website](https://www.sscardapane.it/teaching/reproducibledl/)]

## Objectives for the exercise

- [x] Unit testing the code.
- [x] Automatic formatting with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).
- [x] Integrating checks in pre-commit hooks.
- [x] Adding a GitHub Action to automate the process.




## Preliminary: testing and formatting

The purpose of this exercise is to integrate two ways of checking the code correctness: **formatting** and **testing**. 

### Step 1: Add a unit test

To start, create a `test_audionet.py` file with at least one test function:

```python
def testAudioNet():
  ...
  assert # Test something about the model
```

You can read the [Hydra documentation](https://hydra.cc/docs/next/advanced/unit_testing/) for information on how to load the configuration inside the unit test. If you need an idea for the unit test, PyTorch Lightning has a useful [overfit on batch](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/common/debugging.html#make-model-overfit-on-subset-of-data) function that provides a quick test for the correctness of the model. 

Launch the unit test:

```bash
nosetests
```

### Step 2 - Add formatting

[Black](https://github.com/psf/black) provides a powerful way to automatically format any code according to well-defined style guides.

First, check the adherence of your code to the Black style:

```bash
black --diff --check train.py test_audionet.py
```

Then, try to apply the changes:

```bash
black train.py test_audionet.py
```

> :speech_balloon: Black is an **opinionated** formatting tool. If you do not like the resulting formatting, feel free to skip this step.

## Add a Git hook

Our challenge now is to ensure that testing and formatting are applied to every commit we make. A simple way to ensure this is to add a [pre-commit Git hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks).

> :speech_balloon: Because this is a didactic exercise, we implement the hook from scratch. For a realistic use case, consider [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

First, write a `pre-commit` script that launches our two testing routines. A small template is provided below:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# TODO: Launch the Black checker here
...

# If the command does not return 0 ('correct'), we exit the commit
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
	echo "Code is not formatted correctly!"
	exit 1
fi

# TODO: Repeat a second time for the unit tests
```

Move the file to `.git/hooks/`, and try launching a commit with poorly formatted code (it should fail). Then, repeat after executing the Black formatter.

## Adding a GitHub Action

The Git hook does its job, but it is limited, especially because it runs locally. **Continuous integration** platforms (like CircleCI, Travis CI, ...) provide a way of integrating these checks when a user pushes the code to the remote repository.

For this exercise, we use GitHub Actions: read the [quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) before proceeding.

Create a `push-workflow.yml` file inside a `.github/workflows/` folder. The workflow shoud: (i) install all dependencies for our code; (ii) execute the unit tests; (iii) check adherence of the code to the Black style.

An incomplete template is provided below:

```yaml
name: push-workflow
on: [push]
jobs:
  build: # Build the environment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Checkout the repository
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          sudo apt-get install -y libsndfile1-dev
      - name: Run all unit tests 
        run: ... # TODO: Add code here to run the unitests
      # TODO: Add another step to run Black
```

Push the new file to GitHub, then try committing additional code. You can visualize the running workflows from the Actions tab of the GitHub repository.
